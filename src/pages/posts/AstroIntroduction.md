Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

### 1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project.

> I red the Astro quick start guide and create new Astro project which was really straightforward

### 2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

> Pages structure is very similar to frameworks like remix or nextjs, but Astro also offers markdown pages which turn into html pages out of the box(which is perfect for blog)

### 3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

> Creating or adding new blog posts is really easy. I just created folder posts inside pages and started creating markdown files

### 4. **Deployed the Blog**: The blog was deployed!

> The blog is a static website so i chose netlify. Its free tier is plenty for this blog and it offers continues integration, which means when i push to github my blog will redeploy to netlify .

## Conclusion

### Creating a blog whith Astro is a piece of cake
