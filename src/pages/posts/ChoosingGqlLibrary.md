## Which library to chose

My personal favorite gql library would be [yoga-server](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server) because it's part of big gql ecosystem(which includes our codegen tool as well)

#### Alternatives could be

- [apollo-server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)
- [express-graphql](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/running-an-express-graphql-server/)

For implementation details you can read yoga-server documentation(or the library that you chose)
